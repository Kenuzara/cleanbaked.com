Check back for updates, I'll [Chris] be working on the site as live-project through GitHub Pages.\r\n\r\n### Site Content Inventory\r\nIt's important to start a web design project with a content inventory, that way you both have a good idea of the purpose of the site as well as how to organize the project to achieve the aims of the site. You can't begin to apply the principles of good design if you don't know what you're designing for. \r\nSince this is a portfolio site, there are some fairly clear buckets of need. Since Lauren and I both work independently for the most part, we will need to mirror several common sections to highlight each of our works. We will also have a joint-project section that will grow as we collaborate. To begin with, I'll establish content from a high-level perspective, but the intention is very much for the content inventory to become a content tree that fully describes the site. \r\n\r\n#####JOINT\r\n- Landing Page\r\n- Multi-disciplinary Projects\r\n- Contact Us (toggle for [chris][lauren][both])\r\n- Blog\r\n\r\n#####CHRIS\r\n- About\r\n- Case Studies\r\n- Portfolio (mixed work)\r\n- Travel Photography\r\n\r\n#####LAUREN\r\n- About\r\n- Case Studies\r\n- Research\r\n\r\n- TO DO: More sections(?)\r\n\r\n###Technology \r\nAlong with establishing what the content of a website is, it's important to establish the technology stack that is going to be used as the foundation for the project. Usually this should be decided on by the team working on the project. Since I'll largely be developing this portfolio site on my own, I have the pleasure of making it as idiosyncratic as I desire, but for the sake of saving time will probably leverage well established frameworks to abstract away the parts of development that don't play to my strengths (most back-end work, haha). \r\n- GitHub Pages (Static Site Generation)\r\n- TO DO","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
